Usually we refer to these points as the Lower Left (ll) and Upper Right (ur) points. This is because you can use the x and y coordinates in different combinations to come up with the Upper Left and the Lower Right coordinates. Now, let's say in our GIS we want the ability to EITHER calculate the Euclidean distance between two points or calculate the area of a Bounding box represented as two points.\n",
