# GeoComputing-Project

# 1. Geocomputing Data Processor MVP 1
This MVP focused on developing a foundational tool for reading, processing, and analyzing geospatial data using Python. It integrated core functions such as loading shapefiles and raster data, performing spatial joins, and basic map visualization. The project served as a practical introduction to geocomputing workflows and data handling. It laid the groundwork for more advanced spatial analysis in later MVPs and emphasized reproducible code and data pipelines.

# 2. HealthAccessGIS (MVP 2)
HealthAccessGIS is a GIS tool designed to identify and visualize areas in urban environments with limited access to healthcare facilities. By overlaying population density with healthcare locations, the tool highlights disparities in access and supports urban planning decisions. It integrates raster and vector data with interactive mapping to provide insights for public health and infrastructure development. The main challenge addressed was ensuring clean, accurate spatial datasets and user-friendly visualization for stakeholders.

# 3. Public Libraries and Environment MVP3
This project explores the relationship between public libraries and surrounding environmental conditions using NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index). The MVP overlays library locations with environmental data to support planning, outreach, and service expansion decisions. Key features include geocoding, NDVI integration, and basic visualization of environmental factors affecting library accessibility. It focuses on core MVP principles by delivering minimum functionality for early testing, while addressing challenges in data integration and user interface design.

# 4. Green Space Accessibility (Final Project)
The Green Space Accessibility project simulates and visualizes public access to green spaces in Minnesota using geospatial data. It identifies underserved areas lacking park access and proposes potential locations for new green spaces. The project uses tools like GeoPandas, Folium, and Shapely to analyze accessibility patterns. It supports equitable urban planning by promoting healthier and more inclusive public spaces through spatial insights.

# 5. NYC Traffic Accident Analysis (Grad Project)
This project analyzes traffic accident patterns in New York City to assess geospatial risk and enhance urban safety. It applies spatial clustering, temporal analysis, and multi-layer visualization to reveal high-risk zones and time patterns. The interactive web maps provide actionable insights for city planners, emergency responders, and commercial fleets. By integrating technical analysis with decision-making tools, this project demonstrates advanced spatial reasoning and impactful data storytelling.

# 6. Labs Tasks (Throughout Course)
For most of the lab projects, Minnesota shapefiles or coordinate datasets were used to explore and understand spatial concepts. These hands-on tasks involved learning key geocomputing operations such as spatial joins, raster clipping, and coordinate transformations. They helped build confidence in using Python-based geospatial libraries like GeoPandas and Rasterio. The Minnesota-based data provided a consistent, real-world context for practicing spatial analysis techniques.
